		<h1>Thick-Style Lebanese Garlic Sauce</h1>

		<p>
			This version is a fail-safe recipe that our family has perfected for the
			Lebanese Garlic Sauce. It can be used as a condiment on grilled meats, as
			a salad dressing, and in dishes that require good garlic flavor. We have
			found immersion blending works much better than using the blender. If you
			double the batch, don't double the salt, rather use 1 1/2 tablespoons.
