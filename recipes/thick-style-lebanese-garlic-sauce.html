		<h1>Thick-Style Lebanese Garlic Sauce</h1>

		<p>
			This version is a fail-safe recipe that our family has perfected for the
			Lebanese Garlic Sauce. It can be used as a condiment on grilled meats, as
			a salad dressing, and in dishes that require good garlic flavor. We have
			found immersion blending works much better than using the blender. If you
			double the batch, don't double the salt, rather use 1 1/2 tablespoons.

		<h2>ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>1 head garlic, minced</li>
			<li>1 tablespoon sea salt</li>
			<li>Â½ cup fresh lemon juice</li>
			<li>1 cup vegetable oil</li>
			<li>1 cup olive oil (not extra virgin)</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Steps</h3>

		<ol>
			<li>
				Place the garlic, salt, lemon juice, vegetable oil, and olive oil in a
				quart-sized jar.
			</li>
			<li>
				Submerge an immersion blender in the mixture to the bottom of the jar.
			</li>
			<li>
				Mix with the blender resting on the bottom of the jar until the
				ingredients thicken, 1 to 2 minutes.
			</li>
			<li>
				Angle the mixer to pull ingredients from the sides of the jar and lift
				it toward the top to better combine.
			</li>
			<li>
				Continue blending until the mixture reaches a texture similar to
				mayonnaise.
			</li>
		</ol>
